## Servo easing library for Arduino
This is a library for smooth servo movements. It uses the standard Arduino Servo library and therefore has its restrictions regarding pins and platform support.<br/>
As an alternative to the Arduino Servo library, ServoEasing can be used with a [PCA9685 servo expander](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver?view=all) using the Arduino Wire library or a compatible one (and their restrictions).<br/>
For **ESP32** you need to install the Arduino ESP32Servo library.<br/><br/>
For **AVR**, if you need only one or two servos, you may want to use the included [Lightweight Servo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo) instead of the Arduino Servo library because it uses only the internal Timer1 with no software overhead and has no problems with interrupt blocking libraries like SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple.<br/>
For instructions how to enable these alternatives see [Modifying library properties](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing#modifying-library-properties)

### Features
- **Linear** and 9 other ease movements are provided.
- All servos can move **synchronized** or **independently**.
- **Non blocking** movements are enabled by using **startEaseTo\* functions** by reusing the interrupts of the servo timer Timer1 or using a dedicated timer on other platforms. This function is not available for all platforms.
- Trim value for each servo may be set.
- Reverse operation of servo is possible eg. if it is mounted head down.
- Allow to specify an arbitrary mapping between degreen and microseconds by `attach(int aPin, int aMicrosecondsForServoLowDegree, int aMicrosecondsForServoHighDegree, int aServoLowDegree, int aServoHighDegree)` 

## Usage
Just call **myServo.startEaseTo()** instead of **myServo.write()** and you are done. Or if you want to wait (blocking) until servo has arrived, use **myServo.easeTo()**. Speed of movement can be set by **myServo.setSpeed()**.<br/>
Do not forget to **set the start position** for the Servo by simply calling **myServo.write()**, since the library has **no knowledge about your servos initial position** and therefore starts at **0 degree** at the first move, which may be undesirable.

### Includes the following **easing functions**:
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Quartic
- Sine (similar to Quadratic)
- Circular
- Back
- Elastic
- Bounce
- User defined

### All easing functions can be used in the following **variants**:
- In
- Out
- InOut
- Bouncing (mirrored Out) e.g. Bouncing of the Sine function results in the upper (positive) half of the sine.

# Modifying library properties
To access the Arduino library files from a sketch, you have to first use *Sketch/Show Sketch Folder (Ctrl+K)* in the Arduino IDE.<br/>
Then navigate to the parallel `libraries` folder and select the library you want to access.<br/>
The library files itself are located in the `src` sub-directory.<br/>
If you did not yet store the example as your own sketch, then with *Ctrl+K* you are instantly in the right library folder.
### Using [Sloeber](http://eclipse.baeyens.it/stable.php?OS=Windows)
If you are using Sloeber as your IDE, you can easily define global symbols at *Properties/Arduino/CompileOptions*.<br/>
![Sloeber settings](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/pictures/SloeberDefineSymbols.png)

## Using PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Expander
To enable the use of the expander, open the library file *ServoEasing.h* and comment out line 37 `#define USE_PCA9685_SERVO_EXPANDER` or define global symbol with `-DUSE_PCA9685_SERVO_EXPANDER` which is not yet possible in Arduino IDE:-(.<br/>
Timer1 is then only needed for the startEaseTo* functions.

## Using the included [Lightweight Servo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo)
Using the **Lightweight Servo Library** reduces sketch size and makes the servo pulse generating immune to other libraries blocking interrupts for a longer time like SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple.<br/>
Up to 2 servos are supported by this library and they must be attached to pin 9 and/or 10.<br/>
To enable it, open the library file *ServoEasing.h* and comment out line 44 `#define USE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` or define global symbol with `-DUSE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` which is not yet possible in Arduino IDE:-(.<br/>
If not using the Arduino IDE, take care that Arduino Servo library sources are not compiled / included in the project.

## Reducing library size
If you have only one or two servos, then you can save program space by using Lightweight Servo library .
This saves 742 bytes FLASH and 42 bytes RAM.<br/>
If you do not need the more complex easing functions like `Sine` etc., which in turn need sin(), cos(), sqrt() and pow(), you can shrink library size by approximately 1850 bytes by commenting out line 107 `#define KEEP_SERVO_EASING_LIBRARY_SMALL` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* or define global symbol with `-DKEEP_SERVO_EASING_LIBRARY_SMALL` which is not yet possible in Arduino IDE:-(.<br/>

# [Examples](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/tree/master/examples)
All examples with up to 2 Servos can be used without modifications with the [Lightweight Servo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo) for AVR by by commenting out line 44 `#define USE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* (see above).

## Simple example
This example does not use interrupts and should therefore run on any platform where the Arduino Servo library is available.<br/><br/>
**Arduino Serial Plotter** result of this example if `#define PRINT_FOR_SERIAL_PLOTTER` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* is enabled.<br/>

## OneServo example
This example moves one Servo with different speeds and using blocking and interrupt commands. The internal LED blinks when using interrupt based commands

## TwoServo and ThreeServo examples
This example shows how to move 2 or 3 servos synchronized or independently.

## SymmetricEasing example
This example shows symmetric (end movement is mirror of start movement) linear, quadratic and cubic movements for 3 servos synchronously.
**Arduino Serial Plotter** result of this example if `#define PRINT_FOR_SERIAL_PLOTTER` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* is enabled.<br/>
![Arduino plot](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/pictures/SymmetricEasing.png)

## AsymmetricEasing example
This example shows asymmetric (end movement is different from start movement) non linear movements for 3 servos synchronously.
It includes a partially **user defined easing function**  `EaseQuadraticInQuarticOut()`.
**Arduino Serial Plotter** result of this example if `#define PRINT_FOR_SERIAL_PLOTTER` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* is enabled.<br/>

## ContinuousRotatingServo example
Example for using the servoEasing library to create speed ramps for a continuous rotating servo. This example rely on your servos stop value being **exacly 1500 microseconds**. If the stop value of your servo is NOT exactly 1500 microseconds, you must modify the `MICROSECONDS_FOR_ROTATING_SERVO_STOP` value in the library file *ServoEasing.h*.

## CatMover example
Demo of using two servos in a pan tilt housing to move a laser pointer.

## QuadrupedControl example
Control 8 servos to move a Quadruped robot.<br/>
The full example with IR remote control, NeoPixel and US distance sensor support is available [here](https://github.com/ArminJo/QuadrupedControl).

## RobotArmControl example
Program for controlling a robot arm with 4 servos using 4 potentiometers and/or an IR Remote.

## PCA9685_Expander example
The OneServo example modified for using a PCA9685 expander board and the standard Arduino Wire library.

## EndPositionsTest example
This example helps you determine the right end values for your servo.<br/>
These values are needed for the `attach()` function, if your servo does not comply to the standard values.
E.g. some of my SG90 servos have a 0 degree period of 620 us instead of the standard 544.<br/>
This example does not use the ServoEasing functions.

## SpeedTest example
This example gives you a feeling how fast your servo can move, what the end position values are and which refresh rate they accept.<br/>
This example does not use the ServoEasing functions.

# Internals
Internally only microseconds (or units (= 4.88 us) if using PCA9685 expander) and not degree are used to speed up things. Other expander or libraries can therefore easily be added.<br/>
On **AVR** Timer1 is used for the Arduino Servo library. To have non blocking easing functions its unused **Channel B** is used to generate an interrupt 100 us before the end of the 20 ms Arduino Servo refresh period. This interrupt then updates all servo values for the next refresh period.

# Supported Platforms
AVR, ESP8266, ESP32, STMF1
Every platform with a Servo library will work in blocking mode. If timer support is available for a platform the library can be ported by adding code for the Timer20ms like is was done for ESP and STM.
Non blocking behavior can always be achieved manually by calling `update()` in a loop - see last movement in [Simple example](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/Simple/Simple.ino).
