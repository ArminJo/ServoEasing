## Servo easing library for Arduino
This is a library for smooth servo movements. It uses the standard Arduino Servo library and therefore has its restrictions regarding pins and platform support.<br/>
Its purpose is to interpolate the movement between two servo positions set by software.<br/>
If your servo control data is e.g. generated by an joystick or other *"slow"* changing inputs and therefore  does not change suddenly or does not jump, **you most likely do not need this library!**<br/>
As well as with the Arduino Servo library, ServoEasing can work with a [PCA9685 servo expander](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver?view=all) which in turn requires the Arduino Wire library or a compatible one (and their restrictions).<br/>
For **ESP32** you need to install the Arduino ESP32Servo library.<br/><br/>
If you require only one or two servos, you may want to use the included [LightweightServo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo) (only for **AVR**), instead of the Arduino Servo library.
The LightweightServo library uses the internal Timer1 with no software overhead and therefore has no problems with **servo jitterring** or interrupt blocking libraries like SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple.<br/>
For instructions how to enable these alternatives, see [Compile options / macros](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing#compile-options--macros-for-this-library).

### Features
- **Linear** and 9 other ease movements are provided.
- All servos can move **synchronized** or **independently**.
- **Non blocking** movements are enabled by using **startEaseTo\* functions** by reusing the interrupts of the servo timer Timer1 or using a dedicated timer on other platforms. This function is not available for all platforms.
- A **trim** value (added to the degree/units/microseconds value requested) for each servo may be set.
- **Reverse operation** of servo is possible eg. if it is mounted head down.
- Allow to specify an arbitrary mapping between degrees and microseconds by `attach(int aPin, int aMicrosecondsForServoLowDegree, int aMicrosecondsForServoHighDegree, int aServoLowDegree, int aServoHighDegree)`.
- **Servo speed** can be specified in **degree per second** or **milliseconds** for the complete move.
- Degree values >= 400 can optionally be taken as microsecond values for the servo pulse.
- All ServoEasing objects are accessible by using the [`ServoEasing::ServoEasingArray[]`](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/ThreeServos/ThreeServos.ino#L104).

## [API](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/src/ServoEasing.h#L328)

## Usage
Just call **myServo.startEaseTo()** instead of **myServo.write()** and you are done. Or if you want to wait (blocking) until servo has arrived, use **myServo.easeTo()**.<br/>
- Do not forget to **initially set the start position** for the Servo by simply calling **myServo.write()**, since the library has **no knowledge about your servos initial position** and therefore starts at **0 degree** at the first move, which may be undesirable.<br/>
- And do not forget to **initially set the moving speed** (as degrees per second) with **myServo.setSpeed()** or as **second parameter** to startEaseTo() or easeTo(). Otherwise the Servo will start with the speed of 5 degrees per second, to indicate that speed was not set.<br/>

### Includes the following **easing functions**:
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Quartic
- Sine (similar to Quadratic)
- Circular
- Back
- Elastic
- Bounce
- User defined

### All easing functions can be used in the following **variants**:
- In
- Out
- InOut
- Bouncing (mirrored Out) e.g. Bouncing of the Sine function results in the upper (positive) half of the sine.

### Comparison between Quadratic, Cubic and Sine easings.

# Resolution of servo positioning
- The standard range of 544 to 2400 탎 per 180 degree results in an timing of around **10 탎 per degree**.
- The **Arduino Servo library on AVR** uses an prescaler of 8 at 16 MHz clock resulting in a resolution of **0.5 탎**.
- The **PCA9685 expander** has a resolution of **4.88 탎** per step (@ 20 ms interval) resulting in a resolution of **0.5 degree**.
Digital Servos have a **deadband of approximately 5 탎 / 0.5 degree** which means, that you will see a **stuttering movement** if the moving speed is slow.
If you control them with a PCA9685 expander it may get worse, since one step of 4.88 탎 can be within the deadband, so it takes 2 steps to move the servo from its current position.

# Compile options / macros for this library
To customize the library to different requrements, there are some compile options / macros available.<br/>
These macros must be defined in your program before the line `#include "ServoEasing.hpp"` to take effect.<br/>
 Or define the macro with the -D compiler option for global compile (the latter is not possible with the Arduino IDE, so consider using [Sloeber](https://eclipse.baeyens.it).<br/>
| Option | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `USE_PCA9685_SERVO_EXPANDER` | disabled | Enables the use of the PCA9685 I2C expander chip/board. |
| `USE_SERVO_LIB` | disabled | Use of PCA9685 normally disables use of regular servo library. You can force additional using of regular servo library by defining `USE_SERVO_LIB`. See [below](#using-pca9685-16-channel-servo-expander). |
| `PROVIDE_ONLY_LINEAR_MOVEMENT` | disabled | Disables all but LINEAR movement. Saves up to 1540 bytes FLASH. |
| `DISABLE_COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS` | disabled | Disables the SINE, CIRCULAR, BACK, ELASTIC and BOUNCE easings. Saves up to 1850 bytes FLASH. |
| `MAX_EASING_SERVOS` | 12, 16(for PCA9685) | Saves 4 byte RAM per servo. If this value is smaller than the amount of servos declared, attach() will return error and other library functions will not work as expected.<br/>Of course all *AllServos*() functions and isOneServoMoving() can't work correctly! |
| `ENABLE_MICROS_AS_DEGREE_PARAMETER` | disabled | Enables passing also microsecond values as (target angle) parameter (see [OneServo example](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/OneServo/OneServo.ino#L93)). Requires additional 128 Bytes FLASH. |
| `PRINT_FOR_SERIAL_PLOTTER` | disabled | Generate serial output for Arduino Plotter (Ctrl-Shift-L). |
| `DEBUG` | disabled | Generates lots of lovely debug output for this library. |
| `USE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` | disabled | Makes the servo pulse generating immune to other libraries blocking interrupts for a longer time like SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple. See below. Saves up to 742 bytes FLASH and 42 bytes RAM. |

# Modifying compile options
### Modifying compile options with Arduino IDE
First, use *Sketch > Show Sketch Folder (Ctrl+K)*.<br/>
If you did not yet stored the example as your own sketch, then you are instantly in the right library folder.<br/>
Otherwise you have to navigate to the parallel `libraries` folder and select the library you want to access.<br/>
In both cases the library files itself are located in the `src` directory.<br/>

### Modifying compile options with Sloeber IDE
If you are using Sloeber as your IDE, you can easily define global symbols with *Properties > Arduino > CompileOptions*.<br/>
![Sloeber settings](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/pictures/SloeberDefineSymbols.png)

## Using PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Expander
To enable the use of the expander, open the library file *ServoEasing.h* and activate the line `#define USE_PCA9685_SERVO_EXPANDER`.<br/>
In expander mode, timer1 is only required for the startEaseTo* functions.

Be aware that the PCA9685 expander is **reset** at the first `attach()` and **initialized** at every further `attach()`.<br/>
To control simultaneously servos with the Arduino Servo library i.e. servos which are directly connected to the Arduino board, activate the line `#define USE_SERVO_LIB` in the library file *ServoEasing.h*.<br/>
In this case you should attach the expander servos first in order to initialize the expander board correctly.
And as long as no servo using the Arduino Servo library is attached, the expander servos will not move,
which should not be a problem since you normally attach all servos in `setup()`.<br/>
**Resolution** of the is PCA9685 signal is approximately **0.5 degree**.

On the **ESP32 the I2C library is only capable to run at 100 kHz**, because it interferes with the Ticker / Timer library used.
Even with 100 kHz clock we have some dropouts / NAK's because of sending address again instead of first data.<br/>
Since the raw transmission time of 32 Servo positions is 17.4 탎 @ 100 kHz, not more than 2 expander boards can be connected to one I2C bus on an ESP32 board, if all servos should move simultaneously.<br/>
If you do not use any timer in your program you can increase speed up to 800 kHz. Maybe you have to attach 2x2k2 Ohm pullup resistors to the I2C lines to have it working reliably.

## Using the included [Lightweight Servo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo) for AVR
Using the **Lightweight Servo Library** reduces sketch size and makes the servo pulse generating immune to other libraries blocking interrupts for a longer time like SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple.<br/>
Up to 2 servos are supported by this library and they must be physically attached to pin 9 and/or 10 of the Arduino board.<br/>
To enable it, open the library file *ServoEasing.h* and activate the line `#define USE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` or define global symbol with `-DUSE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` which is not yet possible in Arduino IDE:-(.<br/>
If not using the Arduino IDE, take care that Arduino Servo library sources are not compiled / included in the project.

# [Examples](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples)
All examples with up to 2 Servos can be used without modifications with the [Lightweight Servo library](https://github.com/ArminJo/LightweightServo) for AVR by by commenting out the line `#define USE_LEIGHTWEIGHT_SERVO_LIB` in the library file *ServoEasing.h* (see above).

## [Simple example](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/Simple/Simple.ino)

# Servo utilities

## [EndPositionsTest example](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/EndPositionsTest/EndPositionsTest.ino)
This example helps you determine the right end values for your servo.<br/>
These values are required for the `attach(int aPin, int aInitialDegree, int aMicrosecondsForServo0Degree, int aMicrosecondsForServo180Degree)` function, if your servo does not comply to the standard values.
E.g. some of my SG90 servos have a 0 degree period of 620 탎 instead of the standard 544.<br/>
This example does not use the ServoEasing functions.

## [SpeedTest example](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing/blob/master/examples/SpeedTest/SpeedTest.ino)
This example gives you a feeling how fast your servo can move, what the end position values are and which refresh rate they accept.<br/>
This example does not use the ServoEasing functions.
Not for ESP8266 because it requires 2 analog inputs.

# Internals
The API accepts only degree (except for write() and writeMicrosecondsOrUnits()) but internally only microseconds (or units (= 4.88 탎) if using PCA9685 expander) and not degree are used to speed up things. Other expander or servo libraries can therefore easily be used.<br/>

# Supported Arduino architectures
**Every Arduino architecture with a Servo library** will work without any modifications in blocking mode.<br/>
Non blocking behavior can always be achieved manually by calling `update()` in a loop - see last movement in [Simple example](examples/Simple/Simple.ino).<br/>
Interrupt based movement (movement without calling `update()` manually in a loop) is supported for the following Arduino architectures:<br/>
**avr, megaavr, sam, samd, esp8266, esp32, stm32, STM32F1 and apollo3.**

## Timer usage for interrupt based movement
On **AVR** Timer1 is used for the Arduino Servo library. To have non blocking easing functions its unused **Channel B** is used to generate an interrupt 100 탎 before the end of the 20 ms Arduino Servo refresh period. This interrupt then updates all servo values for the next refresh period.
| Platform | Timer | Library providing the timer |
|---|---|---|
| avr | Timer1 | Servo.h |
| ATmega | Timer5 | Servo.h |
| megaavr | TCA0 |  |
| sam | ID_TC8 (TC2 channel 2) |  |
| samd | TC5 |  |
| esp8266 + esp32 | Ticker | Ticker.h |
| stm32 | TIM3 | HardwareTimer.h |
| STM32F1 | 3 or 7 | HardwareTimer.h |
| Teensy |  | IntervalTimer |
| apollo3 | timer 3 segment A |  |

## Adding a new platform / board
If timer support is available for a platform the library can be ported by adding code for the Timer20ms like is was done for ESP and STM.<br/>
To add a new platform, the following steps have to be performed:
1. If the new platform has an **Arduino compatible Servo library**, fine, otherwise include the one required for this platform like it is done for ESP32 [here](src/ServoEasing.h#L83).
2. You need a **20ms interrupt source** providing the functions enableServoEasingInterrupt() and (optional) disableServoEasingInterrupt(). Extend these functions with code for the new platform. Place includes and timer definitions at top of *ServoEasing.cpp*.
3. If your interrupt source requires an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) place it after disableServoEasingInterrupt() where all the other ISR are located.
4. To test the new platform, you may want to enable **TRACE output** by commenting out the line `#define TRACE` in *ServoEasing.cpp*
and enabling **interrupt timing feedback** by commenting out the line `#define MEASURE_SERVO_EASING_INTERRUPT_TIMING` in *ServoEasing.h*.
5. If it works for you, please issue a Pull Request, to share your efforts with the community.

Good luck!

# Troubleshooting
If you see strange behavior, you can open the library file *ServoEasing.h* and activate the line `#define TRACE` or `#define DEBUG`.
This will print internal information visible in the Arduino *Serial Monitor* which may help finding the reason for it.
